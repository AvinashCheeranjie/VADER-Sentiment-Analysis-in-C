analyze emotions, opinions, and subjective information within text data. Itâ€™s widely employed to
assess sentiments in social media posts, customer reviews, and other written feedback, categorizing

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a rule-based sentiment analysis
tool specifically tuned for social media. It uses a predefined lexicon of words associated with specific
sentiment intensities, making it effective at handling context-heavy content such as slang, emojis,
and varying intensities of emotions. VADER outputs sentiment scores for positive, negative, and
neutral tones, as well as a compound score that represents the overall sentiment. For more details,
